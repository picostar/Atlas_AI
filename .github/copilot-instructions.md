# Project Process Instructions

## atlas_ai Use
- This file is the source of truth for AI instructions in this repository.
- For automatic loading by common tools, keep these files at the repository root:
	- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
	- `CLAUDE.md`
	- `CHATGPT.md`
	- `GEMINI.md` when Gemini workflows are in scope
	- `GROK.md` when Grok workflows are in scope
	- `DEEPSEEK.md` when DeepSeek workflows are in scope
	- `AGENTS.md`
	- `ATLAS.md`
- If you copy this kit into another repository, copy the files to that repository root. Do not leave them buried in a nested subfolder if you expect auto-loading to work.

## Project Context
- This is a reusable AI coding agent process kit for any software project. Modern labels for this kind of repository include agentic workflow scaffold, AI agent instruction scaffold, and agent-ready project scaffold.
- Keep project-specific values in repo docs, config files, or secret stores, not in these instruction files.
- Keep environment URLs, credentials, tokens, tenant IDs, and deployment targets out of committed instruction files.
- Keep reusable stack-pattern choices in `patterns/stack-patterns/`, not in `ATLAS.md` or the thin agent pointer files.
- Keep reusable UX-pattern choices in `patterns/ux-patterns/`, not in `ATLAS.md` or the thin agent pointer files.

## Local Secrets File
- Use `secrets.md` at the repository root for local secure secrets, credentials, and keys.
- Keep `secrets.md` gitignored and local-only.
- Do not place secrets in any other file by default.
- If the user explicitly asks for a different location, warn about commit and leakage risk first, then proceed only after confirmation.
- Before asking the user for credentials, tokens, keys, or other secret values, check `secrets.md` first if it exists.

## Project Accounts File
- Use `accounts.md` at the repository root for non-secret cloud destination and provider account binding.
- Keep `accounts.md` committed when it exists. It may contain subscription IDs, resource group names, project IDs, account IDs, regions, zones, deployment target names, and provider account notes.
- Do not store credentials, keys, tokens, passwords, connection strings, or deployment secrets in `accounts.md`.
- Before cloud, hosting, deployment, infrastructure, or provider CLI work, check `accounts.md` first if it exists.
- If `accounts.md` conflicts with live CLI state, repo guardrails, or user instructions, stop and ask which account, subscription, resource group, project, zone, or target to use.

## Split Repo Layout Handling
- Some repositories keep control docs and AI instruction files at the repo root while the runnable application lives in a child directory one level down.
- In that layout, treat the directory that contains `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `ATLAS.md`, and `docs/` as the control root.
- Keep MRD, PRD, ESD, CGR results, and other governance artifacts under the existing `docs/cgr/` directory at that control root.
- If runtime code is needed and the repo root does not contain the application, inspect immediate child directories and use the best-fit child directory as the code root without moving docs or instruction files there.
- If the repo root does not have `docs/cgr/` but exactly one immediate child directory does, use that child as the effective project root for document work. If multiple child directories qualify, ask the user which one to use.
- Do not create a duplicate `docs/` tree inside a nested app folder when a repo-root `docs/` tree already exists.

## Template And Scaffold Repo Behavior
- This repository may be operating either as a reusable kit or as an adopted live project.
- If `docs/agile/` files still contain obvious placeholder markers, such as `<!-- PLACEHOLDER:` comments, repeated `TBD` values, or example devtasks, treat the repository as a scaffold or template unless there is clear evidence it has been activated as a live project.
- In scaffold or template mode, do not treat placeholder agile docs as ATLAS failures by themselves.
- In scaffold or template mode, assess template integrity, installer behavior, prompt coverage, instruction coherence, and adoption readiness instead of live delivery readiness.
- When giving startup, launch, realignment, or closeout guidance in scaffold or template mode, describe the next step in terms of maintaining the kit or adopting it into a real project.

## Response Guidelines
- No em-dashes. Use commas, periods, or " -- " instead.
- No special symbols or Unicode characters.
- No emoji.
- Plain ASCII text only.
- Standard markdown formatting is fine.
- When generating or editing project files, follow the same rules.
- When authoring prose docs, such as status, devcycle, retro, design notes, READMEs, and governance artifacts, also apply the writing-quality standard in `.github/tropes.md` to avoid common AI writing tells.

## Read Order
1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` -- this file
2. `ATLAS.md` -- default development process and task lifecycle
3. `docs/cgr/PS.md` -- optional project stages and document gates, only when the project uses formal EVT/DVT/PVT/GA stages
4. `.github/prompts/cgr.prompt.md` -- optional governance review prompt, only when governance or stage-gate review is requested
5. If `patterns/stack-patterns/active-stack-pattern.md` exists and the task affects architecture, hosting, deployment, infrastructure, or platform selection, read it before proposing or changing the stack.
6. If `patterns/ux-patterns/active-ux-pattern.md` exists and the task affects layout, navigation, page hierarchy, interaction flow, or UI generation, read it before proposing or changing UX structure.
7. Repo-specific planning docs if they exist, such as `docs/agile/devcycle.md`, `docs/agile/retro.md`, `docs/agile/backlog.md`, `docs/agile/status.md`
8. Repo-specific project docs if they exist, such as MRD, PRD, ESD, architecture docs, ADRs, runbooks, and config references

## Startup And Greeting Behavior
- If the user opens with a greeting or start-of-session phrase, such as `hi`, `hello`, `good morning`, `goodmorning`, or `ready to start`, treat it as a request for a quick project check-in.
- Review where the project stands before proposing work. Use the read order above, then prioritize `docs/agile/status.md` for current state, `docs/agile/devcycle.md` for active work, and `docs/agile/backlog.md` if the active cycle is empty or unclear.
- If the user opens with `atlas`, treat it as the same startup check-in flow.
- During startup check-in, if `.github/prompts/cgr.prompt.md` is present and governance is enabled for this project, check whether live MRD, PRD, and ESD artifacts exist in `docs/cgr/`.
- If governance is enabled and live MRD, PRD, or ESD artifacts are missing, ask a single yes or no question: "Do you want to run CGR bootstrap now to generate draft MRD, PRD, and ESD from seed, reference, and project source materials?"
- If the repository appears to be a scaffold or template, review template integrity and adoption readiness instead of expecting live project status.
- Confirm whether the project appears ready to begin the next task. Mention obvious blockers, missing planning artifacts, or stale status if they affect readiness.
- Suggest the next step using the ATLAS dev cycle loop. Prefer the next active dev task, or if none is active, recommend pulling the next priority into a new cycle.
- Keep this startup response brief and operational. It should orient the user, confirm readiness, and point to the next concrete action.

## Launch And Execute Behavior
- If the user uses a short launch phrase, such as `do it`, `lets go`, `let's go`, `go ahead`, `start`, `proceed`, `make it so`, `engage`, `hit it`, or `punch it`, treat it as authorization to begin work.
- If the user says `atlas update`, treat it as a request to use root-level `atlas_update.md` as a plan-first legacy project update prompt.
- For `atlas update`, detect local canonical layout first and preserve local naming and path conventions by default, including `ATLAS.md` versus `atlas.md`, `patterns/*` versus `docs/reference/*-patterns`, and `docs/cgr/` versus legacy CGR paths.
- For `atlas update`, only migrate layout paths after explicit human approval. Plan-first output must mark move, rename, or delete actions as approval-gated.
- For `atlas update`, include stack and UX pattern template availability in the plan and import guidance. Handle missing pattern families gracefully and document follow-up.
- For `atlas update`, classify legacy account-binding versus secret material before edits. Build committed `accounts.md` from non-secret values only, keep secrets in local-only `secrets.md`, and never copy secret values to committed files.
- For `atlas update`, prefer tracked retirement path `docs/reference/retired-docs/` for historical artifacts and warn before any move into ignored directories.
- For `atlas update`, create and record a rollback path before any update edits. Use a pre-update git branch or tag when git exists, or a timestamped filesystem backup path when git is absent.
- For `atlas update`, use deterministic validation criteria, including pre and post checks, reference integrity, secret leak checks, pattern availability checks, and Windows `safe.directory` fallback when needed.
- If the user says `CGR`, `run CGR`, `atlas cgr`, or `do CGR`, treat it as a request to run the governance workflow defined in `.github/prompts/cgr.prompt.md` (or root-level `atlas_cgr.md` when this kit is not installed in the target).
- For `CGR`: if `docs/cgr/` or live MRD, PRD, and ESD artifacts do not exist yet, create `docs/cgr/` and bootstrap draft docs from `seed.md`, `docs/reference/`, and relevant source files already in the project root, such as marketing copy, product notes, sales material, website content, specs, or discovery notes. Then run CGR and write `docs/cgr/CGR-results.md`.
- For `CGR`: if live MRD, PRD, or ESD artifacts already exist in `docs/cgr/`, use them as the base and improve them using current user instructions plus any new materials in `seed.md`, `docs/reference/`, or relevant project source files.
- For `CGR` remote-source phrasing: if the user says something like `do CGR from github picostar/Atlas_AI on folder "<localpath>"`, `run CGR using picostar/atlas_ai on <localpath>`, or any equivalent that names a source kit repo plus a local target folder, treat it as a remote-sourced CGR run.
  - Source kit resolution order: (a) local checkout of `picostar/Atlas_AI` if one is already open in this workspace or under a known parent directory, (b) `.github/prompts/cgr.prompt.md` plus `docs/cgr/*_TEMPLATE.md` already present in the source-kit path, (c) fetch the current contents of `atlas_cgr.md`, `.github/prompts/cgr.prompt.md`, `docs/cgr/MRD_TEMPLATE.md`, `docs/cgr/PRD_TEMPLATE.md`, and `docs/cgr/ESD_TEMPLATE.md` from `github.com/picostar/Atlas_AI` on the default branch via the fetch tool, (d) if none of the above succeed, ask the user for a local path to the source kit.
  - Target folder resolution: treat the quoted path as the CGR target root. If it does not exist, ask before creating it. Do not modify any folder other than the named target.
  - Execution: apply the full CGR workflow from `.github/prompts/cgr.prompt.md` against the target folder, write all output under `<target>/docs/cgr/`, and follow the bootstrap quality floor (substantive answers, `[DRAFT INFERENCE]` tags, `TBD` only for owner-only facts).
  - Scope guard: never write into the source kit folder while running a remote-sourced CGR against a separate target.
- If the user says `newproject` or `atlas project`, treat it as a request to use root-level `atlas_newproject.md` as the prompt-first new-project bootstrap workflow.
- Before acting, perform a brief ATLAS readiness check. Review the current state, confirm the next task is clear, and look for obvious blockers or missing planning context.
- Use `docs/agile/status.md` for current state, `docs/agile/devcycle.md` for the active task, and `docs/agile/backlog.md` if the active cycle is empty or unclear.
- If the repository appears to be a scaffold or template, use the next clear maintenance or adoption task rather than expecting an active live-project devcycle.
- If the next task is clear and no blocker prevents progress, start executing it immediately rather than waiting for another confirmation.
- If a blocker exists, call it out briefly and either resolve it or ask the minimum clarifying question needed to proceed.
- For `newproject`, use prompt-first setup only so bootstrap works across Windows, Linux, and macOS. Do not invoke deprecated legacy bootstrap scripts during prompt-driven newproject execution.
- For `newproject`, run an explicit setup questionnaire before applying changes. Capture yes or no choices for scaffold, git init when needed, PS, CGR, stack pattern selection, UX pattern selection, and GitHub repo creation. If a stack pattern is selected, capture API-first posture as yes or no. Do not silently apply defaults unless the user explicitly says to use defaults.
- For `newproject`, present stack and UX pattern choices as numbered menus from available templates and accept number or label answers. Do not ask users for freeform template filenames or paths. When asking API-first posture, explain that API-first expects API results when feasible and smoketest verification of endpoints plus OpenAPI or Swagger docs when feasible.
- For `newproject`, do not end the run with only installed-file notes, diagnostics, or generic next-step options. A successful run must either capture setup answers and apply them, or stop on a clear blocker.
- For `newproject`, if a partial install already happened before the questionnaire, treat it as interrupted bootstrap. Ask only the missing setup questions, then continue execution to completion in the same run.
- For `newproject`, if the target already contains Atlas control files at the repo root, stop and tell the user to use `atlas_update.md` from the kit for a plan-first legacy project update.
- For `newproject`, if the target contains pre-existing user files, preserve them by moving them into `docs/reference/preexisting-root/`. If `.git` already exists, adopt that repository rather than reinitializing it.
- For `newproject`, when setup uses a local source-kit folder in the target root, such as `atlas_ai` or `Atlas_AI`, treat that folder as temporary bootstrap input. Remove it after installation and do not stage or commit it.
- For `newproject`, if the user references `github picostar/Atlas_AI`, interpret that as source-kit location only. Do not clone Atlas_AI into the target folder or a new subfolder unless the user explicitly asks to clone it. Apply bootstrap in the current target folder.
- For `newproject`, if a user asks why legacy scripts were not used, explain that prompt-driven bootstrap is the supported path.
- If the user says `atlas refresh models` or `refresh model tiers`, treat it as a request to refresh the `model-tier-advisor` skill's CU-to-model-tier mapping tables by consulting artificialanalysis.ai and ockbench.github.io (when web-fetch tools are available), update the `Verified` dates and any changed tier assignments, and report what changed.
- When picking up a DT or RDT and assigning or confirming `eMOE`, if the active agent is a Claude model, OpenAI Codex/ChatGPT, or GitHub Copilot, apply the `model-tier-advisor` skill to state a suggested model tier for the task as advisory context.
- Keep the response short and action-oriented. The purpose of these phrases is to move from readiness review into execution.

## Session Close And Sign-Off Behavior
- If the user closes with a sign-off phrase, such as `good night`, `goodnight`, `goodbye`, `that's all`, or `we are done`, treat it as a request for a quick end-of-session check.
- Review whether the current work appears to follow ATLAS. Check for obvious closeout gaps such as missing CLI or script smoketest confirmation, missing UAT handoff or explicit non-UAT note, missing task-level commit, missing GitHub follow-up, missing `retro.md` updates for completed work, missing `status.md` updates for shipped changes, or completed items still left in `devcycle.md`.
- If the repository appears to be a scaffold or template, do not treat placeholder agile docs as closeout failures unless the user was specifically editing those docs.
- Confirm whether the working state appears ready to pause or close for the session. If there are unfinished closeout steps, call them out clearly and briefly.
- Confirm the current devtask's commit and GitHub follow-up status as part of closeout. If the repo has no remote or the workflow cannot proceed, call that out explicitly.
- When closing out a completed DT or RDT, include a brief self-estimated usage note (Light/Moderate/Heavy) rather than an exact token count, and point to the host tool's own precise usage feature (e.g. Claude Code's `/cost` command or status line) for exact figures.
- Keep this sign-off response brief, operational, and focused on readiness, documentation state, and the next optional closeout action.

## Working Rules
- Follow `ATLAS.md` as the default process unless the repository explicitly defines a different one.
- Work on one dev task at a time.
- Smoke test each task with CLI commands or a script before considering it complete.
- Every devtask and reset devtask must include both a `Smoketest:` section and a `UAT:` section. If a task is not user-facing, the `UAT:` section must explicitly say that it is not UAT-eligible and state the required internal validation.
- When `patterns/stack-patterns/active-stack-pattern.md` says API-first mode is enabled, every devtask and reset devtask should include an API result when feasible, and `Smoketest:` should include API endpoint verification plus OpenAPI or Swagger documentation verification when feasible.
- If the repository maintains a full regression/UAT harness (see `docs/agile/testing/README.md` if present), update its coverage before closeout when a devtask or reset devtask changes deployed behavior. If no full-harness row is appropriate, record why in the retrospective log.
- After each completed devtask, create a task-level git commit.
- After each completed devtask, if a GitHub remote exists, push the branch and perform the repo's GitHub follow-up step, typically creating or updating a pull request. If no remote exists, record that blocker clearly.
- Do not merge to `main` after every devtask by default. Merge the pull request when the dev cycle, phase, or other reviewable task bundle is ready to close, after required status checks and review are complete.
- Keep completed work out of the active task list. The active list is a burn-down, not a historical log.
- Record implementation details, issues, decisions, and lessons learned in the repo's retrospective log if one exists.
- Prefer feature branches over direct work on `main` when working in a git repository.
- Remove matching `*_TEMPLATE.md` files from `docs/cgr/` once live MRD, PRD, or ESD artifacts exist.
- Do not hardcode project names, tenant values, URLs, credentials, or deployment targets in reusable kits.
- Keep prompt-first newproject as the supported path. Legacy scripts now live under `archive/legacy/` and are deprecated for agent-driven setup.
- For existing or legacy atlas projects, use root-level `atlas_update.md` as a plan-first prompt. It may recommend consolidating legacy account-binding files into committed `accounts.md`, but execution requires explicit human approval.

## Recommended Repo Structure
- `docs/agile/` -- active planning and delivery docs such as `devcycle.md`, `retro.md`, `backlog.md`, `status.md`
- `docs/cgr/` -- MRD, PRD, ESD, ADRs, roadmaps, governance records
- `docs/reference/` -- setup notes, integration references, runbooks, external system constraints
- `patterns/` -- stack and UX baseline patterns, active baselines, and template catalogs
- `scripts/` -- reusable operational and verification scripts
- `archive/` -- superseded artifacts and one-off outputs, usually gitignored

## AI Tool Coverage
- Copilot uses `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Claude Code uses `CLAUDE.md`.
- ChatGPT-oriented workflows use `CHATGPT.md` as a thin pointer to this file and `ATLAS.md`.
- Gemini-oriented workflows can use `GEMINI.md` as a thin pointer to this file and `ATLAS.md`.
- Grok-oriented workflows can use `GROK.md` as a thin pointer to this file and `ATLAS.md`.
- DeepSeek-oriented workflows can use `DEEPSEEK.md` as a thin pointer to this file and `ATLAS.md`.
- Codex-style agents commonly use `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep thin pointers minimal and aligned with this file and `ATLAS.md` so process logic stays in one place.

## Common Mistakes To Avoid
- Do not bake one project's names, URLs, roles, or vendors into a reusable kit.
- Do not reference files that do not exist in the copied kit without labeling them as optional or recommended.
- Do not skip the repo-defined commit and GitHub follow-up steps after a completed devtask.
- Do not keep completed tasks in the active burn-down list using checkboxes, strikethroughs, or DONE labels.
- Do not leave live project artifacts mixed with stale `*_TEMPLATE.md` files in `docs/cgr/`.
- Do not store secrets in committed config or instruction files.
- Do not report an exact token count as if read from a live API. Coding agents cannot query their own token meter mid-session; use a qualitative self-estimate instead (Light/Moderate/Heavy) based on observable signals, and point users to the host tool's own usage feature for precise numbers.
